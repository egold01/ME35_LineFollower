# ME35_LineFollower

Work by Ethan Goldman and Salvatore Novak, Tufts University

Incomplete (it doesn't work) code to drive two motors with PWM using PID control with error calculated from two sensor inputs to follow a line.

Uses DFRobot Fermion: TCS3200 RGB Color Sensor (Breakout) (https://www.dfrobot.com/product-540.html) and RaspberryPi.
